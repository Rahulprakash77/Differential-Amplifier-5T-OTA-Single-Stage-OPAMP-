# Differential-Amplifier-5T-OTA-Single-Stage-OPAMP-
A differential amplifier or 5T-OTA amplifies the difference between inputs while rejecting noise, with the single-stage Op-Amp offering high gain and simplicity. This project enhances skills in low-noise, precision analog design, crucial for applications in sensors, ADCs, and signal processing, emphasizing low power and compactness.
