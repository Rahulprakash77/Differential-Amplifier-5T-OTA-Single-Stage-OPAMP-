### Understanding 6T OTA, Single-Stage Op-Amp, and Differential Amplifier
The 6-Transistor Operational Transconductance Amplifier (6T OTA), Single-Stage Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp), and Differential Amplifier are closely related analog circuit topologies, sharing similar principles while catering to distinct applications. This section explains their similarities and differences, providing clarity on their usage and functionality.

#### 1. Commonality
All three circuits are built around the concept of differential amplification, where the difference between two input signals is amplified while rejecting common-mode noise. They share key design elements:

**Input Stage:** A differential pair of transistors.
**Load Stage:** Typically uses resistive or current mirror loads to convert the differential current into a voltage or further amplify it.
**Biasing:** Requires a steady current source, often implemented using transistors.
These circuits are often the foundation of many analog designs, serving as the first stage in multi-stage amplifiers or standalone low-power solutions.

#### 2. Differences in Design and Purpose
**6T OTA:** This circuit provides a current output proportional to the voltage difference at the inputs, functioning as a transconductance amplifier. It is designed with 6 transistors, including an NMOS current mirror as the tail current source. The 6T OTA is commonly used in applications like filters, modulators, and low-power analog designs due to its current-output nature.

**Single-Stage Op-Amp:** The single-stage operational amplifier amplifies the voltage difference between its inputs and provides a single-ended voltage output. It typically consists of 5 transistors and is used for applications like signal amplification and low-frequency circuits, where simplicity and compactness are prioritized.

**Differential Amplifier:** A basic circuit for amplifying the voltage difference between two inputs, the differential amplifier can have a single-ended or differential output. It often serves as a foundational building block in sensor signal processing and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), emphasizing basic gain with fewer components.

### Circuit Overview
The 6-transistor OTA circuit consists of:

**Input Differential Pair:** Two NMOS transistors that process the differential input signals.
**Current Mirror Load:** Two PMOS transistors form the current mirror, which improves the gain and maintains balanced current flow.
**Output Stage:** The current mirror at the output ensures efficient current transfer and high linearity.
**NMOS Current Mirror as Tail Current Source:** Instead of a conventional constant tail current source, an NMOS-based current mirror is used to provide the differential pair with a steady bias current.

### Circuit Description
**1. Input Stage (Differential Pair):**
Two NMOS transistors M1 and M2 are used to create a differential pair.
The input signals Vin+ and Vin- are applied to their gates.
The differential pair amplifies the difference between the input signals while rejecting the common-mode signals, ensuring noise immunity.

**2. Tail Current Source (NMOS Current Mirror):**
The NMOS transistors M5 and M6 form a current mirror, replacing the conventional constant current source.
This current mirror sets the bias current for the differential pair, maintaining a steady operating point for M1 and M2 Using an NMOS current mirror as a tail source improves current matching and enables better biasing in low-voltage designs.

**3. Load Stage (PMOS Current Mirror):**
The PMOS transistors M3 and M4 form a current mirror that acts as the load for the differential pair.
The current mirror reflects and balances the output currents from the differential pair.
This configuration improves the output impedance and gain of the OTA.

**4. Output Node:**
The output current is taken from the drain of M3 and M4 depending on the design.
The circuit outputs a current proportional to the difference between the input signals, fulfilling the transconductance function
